# Product Overview

The Voucher Module is an enhancement to the Service Portal AI, designed to provide internal teams with the capability to efficiently create, manage, and distribute various types of vouchers. These vouchers can be used for promotional activities, trials, or bundling campaigns, often tied to specific channels or themes like LinkedIn or university programs. The module supports two primary voucher types: LLM Token vouchers (representing usage tokens for specific LLM models) and GPU Credit vouchers (representing credit for GPU usage). The system ensures that only Superadmins can create and manage these vouchers, while regular users can redeem them. This feature is vital for supporting marketing strategies and expanding the user base for LLM and GPU Cloud platforms.
